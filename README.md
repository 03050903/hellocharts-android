HelloCharts for Android
=======================

Charting library for Android compatible with API 8+(Android 2.2). 
Works best when hardware acceleration is available so I recommend using it with API 14+(Android 4.0).

Supports
--------

 - Line chart
 - Column chart
 - Pie chart
 - Bubble chart
 - Combo chart(columns/lines)
 - Preview charts(for column chart and line chart)
 - Animations
 - Zoom(pinch to zoom, double tap zoom), scroll and fling
 - Value selection
 - Customizable labels for values
 - Custom and auto-generated axes(most charts handles four axes: top, bottom, left, right)
 - Some other attributes like colours, fonts, lines thickness, pints radius etc.
